Terasology Misc Repo!
=========================================
This repo is for assorted extras for Terasology

One big possibility is hosting content (think music, sfx, creature models, etc) here in various stages of completion, then including them in a "bigger" version of the Terasology downloadable.

Could automatically generate a summary page in the wiki based on status fields in info files, likewise base game content imports on that.

See [GitHub](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology) for the main project
