Terasology Misc Repo!
=========================================
This repo is for assorted extras for Terasology. Its issue tracker is for general items related to the main site and such, not the game nor the splash site.

One big possibility is hosting content (think music, sfx, creature models, etc) here in various stages of completion, then including them in a "bigger" version of the Terasology downloadable.

Could automatically generate a summary page in the wiki based on status fields in info files, likewise base game content imports on that.

See [GitHub](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/Terasology) for the main project
